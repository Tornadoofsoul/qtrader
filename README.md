> Reinforcement Learning for Portfolio Management

## Why Reinforcement Learning?

1. Learns the **optimal action**, rather than models the market.
2. Adaptive to temporary changes of the market, due to its online training.
3. Optimizes the long-term (cumulative) reward, rather than the instantaneous benefit.
